# odin-recipes

This is the HTML foundations final project to conclude my learning in the HTML basics.

First i was setting up an index.html file the projects root directory. Next step was to create a folder where i was creating the first recipes html-file. Next was building a link to that file into 
the index.html file. Next i was repeating that task two more times. Everything seems to work fine.

SUCCESS
